## Vision for DTube

**DTube aims to reinvent how information and revenue is shared in the video industry.** We want a platform that promotes freedom of speech, by saying a hard *No!* to various mechanisms of censorship. We want all creators to be treated equally and fairly so they can make content accessible for everyone around the world.

    <br />

<h3>Resistant to censorship</h3>
    <p>We're strong advocates of Free Speech and digital freedom: everyone should be able to share and reach information easily. In DTube <em>even we can't tamper with your content or suspend your account</em>. Decentralized features of this platform make your uploads completely tamper and censorship resistant. <em>Your account is an asset which you truely own.</em></p>

    <h3>Crypto rewards</h3>
    <p>DTube is a blockchain based social media platform. <em>You generate crypto rewards by engaging with others</em>, especially by curating and creating content.</p>

    <br />

    <h3>A fair platform with no hidden algorithms</h3>
    <p>On DTube, there are no "secret forces" controlling the visibility and/or monetization of certain videos over others. **The content [ranking](wiki/video-rankings) is decided by the community**. Also: all of DTube's data is public, so it can be analyzed by anyone.</p>

  <div class="four wide column">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtube/docs/master/imgs/noads.png" alt="noads" style="width:50%">
    <br />

    <h3>No intrusive ads</h3>
    <p>To deliver the best user experience **DTube does not put ads into user videos**. Creators remain free to advertise any product or service they would like, directly inside their own videos (at the risk of losing subscribers, perhaps).</p>

## How does it work?

### Using Blockchain as a database

In order to make DTube a truly decentralized solution, we decided to use blockchain technology. And since no blockchains available were fit for the purpose we created our own: **Avalon**.

In short:

- No transaction fees
- No upfront deposit
- Videos can generate rewards

Note for Steem and Hive users: by logging with your Steem/Hive credentials you can use DTube with more than one chain and use interoperable features.

<h2>Using decentralized File Storage</h2>

#### 3rd parties

By using *third party providers* you can embed an existing video (so, technically you're not "uploading" anything). Supported sites include:

- Twitch
- YouTube
- Dailymotion
- Instagram
- LiveLeak
- Vimeo
- Facebook

The video does not have to be your own original content: by doing so, you're becoming a curator and earning your curation rewards. The original uploader still earns their money through ads and partnerships they have on the third party platform.

Keep in mind: videos added to DTube this way have all the limitations of their platform. **If the 3rd party decides to remove the video or censor it for whatever reason, this will affect all embeds, including the one on DTube**. Content added through 3rd parties has zero benefits as far as decentralization goes. 

The recommended way is to use decentralised upload methods: IPFS, BTFS and Skynet.

### How to contribute

DTube is fully [open-source software](https://opensource.org/osd). And since open-source projects form the foundation for our rapidly advancing technological world, we want to make it as easy as possible for DTube users to become DTube contributors. See our [contribution guide](wiki/contribute) to learn how you can help the project.

You can also [contribute to the documentation](wiki/contribute-to-docs).
 
### Using the DTube logo on your own project

The DTube logo is an open source one and you can use it on your website or your own project for any purpose. All you have to do is just access the [mediakit](https://github.com/dtube/about/tree/master/img/kit).
